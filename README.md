# ðŸ“Š Executive Summary

Many online stores struggle to answer three big questions:  
**Who are my best customers? Who might leave soon? And where should I focus my money?**  
Without clear answers, businesses often waste time and budget on the wrong people.

To solve this, I analyzed customer transaction data using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** and **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**. I then applied **clustering methods (K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering)** to group customers with similar shopping behavior. This moved the business away from guesswork and towards data-driven segmentation.

The results gave the business a **clear customer map with 4 distinct groups**:  
- A **tiny VIP segment** (â‰ˆ5â€“7 customers) who buy very often (64â€“118 orders) and spend the most, with an average lifetime value of **$58kâ€“$73k**.  
- A **large mid-value group** (â‰ˆ476â€“602 customers) that buys occasionally (3â€“4 orders) and spends around **$1.2kâ€“$1.4k** each.  
- A **profitable loyal segment** (â‰ˆ39â€“56 customers) who purchase regularly (18â€“23 orders) and bring **$5kâ€“$6k CLV**.  
- An **at-risk group** (â‰ˆ170â€“207 customers) who rarely return (â‰ˆ1 order) and have very low CLV (**$280â€“$298**).  

ðŸŽ‰ With these insights, the store can now:  
- **Protect its revenue** by giving VIPs special care (they are <1% of customers but drive most sales).  
- **Grow profits** by nurturing the high-value loyal group and encouraging the mass segment to buy more often.  
- **Reduce losses** by targeting the at-risk group with win-back campaigns instead of spending blindly.  

In short, this project helps e-commerce businesses **spend smarter, keep their best customers, and grow revenue with focus.**
